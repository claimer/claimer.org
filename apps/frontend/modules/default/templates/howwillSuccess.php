<h1>How will climate compensation work?</h1>
<p>Claimer.org provides registration software and content. Independent registration centres will use this software and content to register individual climate damages. Once compensation is available, registration centres can represent climate-change victims or broker legal representation.</p>
<p>Registering climate damages today makes sense if at least one of the two following assumptions are well-founded:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is a matter of time before public opinion calls for climate-change victims to be compensated from public funds.</li>
  <li>It is a matter of time before the first courts recognise the right of climate-change victims to get partial or full compensation from industries that have caused the climate change. The first attempts to obtain compensation for climate damages via courts are already underway. Please note that multinationals involved in climate change might be sued under any jurisdiction worldwide, not only where their headquarters are based.</li>
</ul>
<p>Claimer.org will inform registration centres about developments in this regard.</p>
