  <h1>What is CLAIMER.org ?</h1>
  <p>Claimer.org facilitates the registration of climate damages by independent registration centres worldwide. Registration of climate damages will make it easier to obtain, in the future, compensation either by legal action against industries causing climate change or from public compensation funds. Claimer.org bridges the gap between climate damages today and future compensation.</p>
  <h2>A matter of justice.</h2>
  Already today, climate change is causing more damage than any other man-made phenomenon. In the future, several hundred million people will lose their property due to climate change. Many of them will even lose their livelihoods. These people deserve and need compensation. Registering climate damages and securing proofs thereof is the crucial first step on the way to compensation.</p>
  <h2>A matter of reason.</h2>
  People know best how to build-up a new life. So it makes sense to compensate individually rather than pouring money into state administrations.</p>
